# Tic-Tac-Toe

A full-stack Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Java backend and a React + Vite frontend.

This was part of an interview I participated in that was ultimately unsuccessful. There was too much stuff here I was only vaguely familiar with (like React and Playwright), and I tried to do Java with VSCode. 

Tic-tac-toe is kind of boring though, as it's a game that can always be taken to a draw with mildly competent players. I'll be resurrecting this soon, probably as a Connect 4-type game, which can have more interesting games and more interesting statistics. 

## Getting Started
